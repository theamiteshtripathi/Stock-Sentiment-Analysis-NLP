# 📈🗞️💸 Stock Sentiment Analysis 

This project uses machine learning to predict stock price movements based on the sentiment of news headlines. The main steps involved are data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and prediction.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theamiteshtripathi/Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
```

2. Change directory: 

```bash
cd Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
```

3. Install the required packages: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Data

The data used in this project consists of news headlines and corresponding stock price movements. The news headlines are preprocessed and vectorized before being used to train the model.

The raw data is located in the `data/raw` directory and the processed data is located in the `data/processed` directory.

## 🎯 Usage

1. Run the preprocessing script: 

```bash
python src/stockSentimentAnalysis/preprocessing/clean_text.py
```

2. Train the model: 

```bash
python src/stockSentimentAnalysis/models/train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model: 

```bash
python src/stockSentimentAnalysis/models/evaluate.py
```

4. Make predictions: 

```bash
python src/stockSentimentAnalysis/models/predict.py
```

## 📈 Results

The performance of the model can be evaluated by running the `evaluate.py` script. The results include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
